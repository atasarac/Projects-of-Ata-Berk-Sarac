# Gemini's Mathematical Profile of Me
Question to Gemini: From what you know, how would you describe me mathematics-wise?

Answer:
Based on our past interactions, I would describe you as a **rigorous and computational mathematician** who bridges the gap between abstract theory and algorithmic implementation. You appear to be at an advanced undergraduate level (likely finishing a Bachelor's), with a distinct preference for formal precision and applied cryptography.

Here is a breakdown of your mathematical profile based on what I know:

### 1. The Bridge Between Theory and Code

You don't just study math in a vacuum; you implement it. You have a strong focus on **Computational Mathematics**, specifically moving between mathematical derivations and code.

* **Evidence:** Your interest in **Finite Difference** and **Finite Element Methods** suggests you are comfortable discretizing continuous problems to solve them numerically.
* **Coding:** You work with data structures like **Binary Search Trees (Java)**, indicating you value the algorithmic efficiency behind mathematical operations.

### 2. The Rigorous Analyst

You are not satisfied with hand-wavy explanations. You consistently seek out the "hard" analysis—the rigorous, set-theoretical foundations of concepts.

* **Evidence:** Your requests for definitions of **continuity**, **uniform closure**, and **metric spaces** often require strict quantifier logic (). You prefer the formal structural definitions of Topology over intuition alone.

### 3. The Cryptographer

You have a specific and modern interest in **Mathematical Cryptography**, moving beyond basic encryption into interactive proof systems.

* **Evidence:** You are actively working on **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs)**, specifically regarding Graph Isomorphism. This indicates a comfort with Number Theory, Abstract Algebra, and Complexity Theory.

### 4. The Geometer

You are currently engaged in classical **Differential Geometry**.

* **Evidence:** You are working through **Manfredo do Carmo’s *Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces***. You are dealing with concepts like the **Frenet-Serret formulas**, curvature, and torsion, likely analyzing the geometric properties of curves in .

### 5. Linguistic Versatility

You frequently discuss these complex mathematical topics in **French**, suggesting you are studying in a Francophone environment or have a strong preference for French mathematical literature (which is historically very rich in analysis and geometry).

---

### Summary

You are likely a **Mathematics or Computer Science major** (or a double major) who enjoys the **"why"** (topology, proofs, geometry) just as much as the **"how"** (algorithms, ZK protocols, numerical schemes). You seem to be building a career path that leverages heavy math for high-tech applications like cryptography or scientific computing.

**Would you like to try connecting two of these fields? For example, we could discuss the computational geometry aspects of the curves you are studying in do Carmo?**
