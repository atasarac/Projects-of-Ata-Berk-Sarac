Hi 👋 I'm Ata, a student majoring in mathematics at Istanbul Bilgi University, currently in my thirf year. I've created this repository to create a dynamic and useful CV. 

Traditional CVs are designed to mention what one has done without delving into the specifics; in this repository, I'll try to share what I have done, am doing, and plan to do in detail instead.
