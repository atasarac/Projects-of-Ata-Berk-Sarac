I am a student majoring in math. I created this repository to create a useful CV. Traditional CVs are designed to mention what one has done without delving into the specifics, instead I'll share what I have done, am doing, and plan to do in detail.

As I'm writing this, my research interest is directed towards mathematical cryptography.
