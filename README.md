# Read Me
I am a student majoring in math. I opened this repository to introduce myself to the math community. I intend to use this repository as a means to investigate papers and share my process in writing a paper (if I ever write one), as well as point certain concepts out. I will especially be interested in giving a visual representation of what I am doing.

### Note 1
I divide math into three main branches as a high-level map, though specific fields might shift based on context. I realize that mathematics resists rigid categorization.

### Note 2
For a taste of history, check out [MacTutor Index](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/) by Edmund Robertson and John O'Connor, and _**Mathematics and Its History**_ by John Stillwell. Also, [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) by Paul Dawkins is a good resource to learn basic stuff.
