# Read Me
I am a student majoring in math. I created this repository to create a useful CV. It's "useful" because instead of mentioning what I've done (starting from elementary school), I'll share what I have done, am doing, and plan to do in detail.

#### Note 1
I divide math into three main branches as a high-level map, though specific fields might shift based on context. I realize that mathematics resists rigid categorization.

#### Note 2
If you're new to mathematics and came across this page by accident, and if you have an interest in history like I do, then check out [*MacTutor Index*](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/) by [Edmund Robertson](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Robertson_Edmund/) and [John O'Connor](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/OConnor/), and _**Mathematics and Its History**_ by [John Stillwell](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/john-stillwell). Also, [*Paul's Online Notes*](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) by [Paul Dawkins](https://www.math.lamar.edu/faculty/dawkins/dawkins.aspx) is a good online resource to learn fundamental stuff.
