# Projects-of-Ata-B.-Sara√ß
I am a student majoring in math. This whole site is my contribution and presentation of myself to the math (and hopefully the CS) community.
I divide math into two main branches: _discrete_ and _continuous_. I realize, of course, that they intertwine a lot, which I cover under the title _Intertwinement of Branches_. You may question this embranchment and say that it is too general or that it is not complete. I can agree with you on that, but this is the path I chose to follow. I believe it suits my purposes.
