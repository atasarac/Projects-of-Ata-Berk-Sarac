Hi 👋 I'm Ata, a student majoring in mathematics at Istanbul Bilgi University, currently in my third year. Traditional CVs are designed to mention what one has done without delving into the specifics. I've created this repository to create a dynamic and useful CV, I'll try to share the projects I've completed.

I've shared and will be sharing some (complete and uncomplete) tex files I've written over these years just to show that I am, at least, familiar with the topics included.
