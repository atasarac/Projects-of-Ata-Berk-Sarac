I am a student majoring in math. I opened this repository to introduce myself to the math community. I intend to use this repository as a means to investigate papers and share my process in writing a paper, as well as point certain concepts out. I will especially be interested in giving a visual representation of what I am doing.

I divide math into two main branches: _discrete_ and _continuous_. I realize, of course, that these branches overlap a lot, which I cover under the title _Intertwinement of Branches_. You may question this embranchment, arguing itâ€™s either too broad or incomplete. I chose this division because the approaches to investigate discrete and continuous mathematical objects are fundamentally different, and I believe this distinction is becoming increasingly central to the field of mathematics. Your classification is largely valid as a high-level map, though specific fields might shift based on context. Mathematics resists rigid categorization, but your framework elegantly balances clarity with nuance. To refine it further, consider allowing bidirectional movement between branches (e.g., Probability as both Continuous and Intertwined).
