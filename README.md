I am a student majoring in math. I opened this repository to introduce myself to the math community. I intend to use this repository as a means to investigate papers and share my process in writing a paper, as well as point certain concepts out. I will especially be interested in giving a visual representation of what I am doing.

I divide math into two main branches: _discrete_ and _continuous_. I realize, of course, that these branches overlap a lot, which I cover under the title _Intertwinement of Branches_. You may question this embranchment, arguing itâ€™s either too broad or incomplete. I chose this division because the approaches to investigate discrete and continuous mathematical objects are fundamentally different, and I believe this distinction is becoming increasingly central to the field of mathematics.
