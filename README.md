I am a student majoring in math. This whole site is my contribution and presentation of myself to the math community.
I divide math into two main branches: _discrete_ and _continuous_. I realize, of course, that these branches intertwine a lot, which I cover under the title _Intertwinement of Branches_. You may question this embranchment and say that it is too general or that it is not complete. I can agree with you on that, but this suits the best to my purposes.
