I am a student majoring in math. I opened this repository to introduce myself to the math community.

I divide math into two main branches: _discrete_ and _continuous_. I realize, of course, that these branches intertwine a lot, which I cover under the title _Intertwinement of Branches_. You may question this embranchment and say that it is too general or that it is not complete. I divided mathematics into two simply because there are fundamentally different investigations of discrete and continuous mathematical objects, and I believe that math is shaping around this difference.
