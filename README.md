# Read Me
I am a student majoring in math. I opened this repository to introduce myself to the math community. I intend to use this repository as a means to investigate papers and share my process in writing a paper (if I ever write one), as well as point certain concepts out. I will especially be interested in giving a visual representation of what I am doing.

I divide math into three main branches as a high-level map, though specific fields might shift based on context. I realize that mathematics resists rigid categorization.
