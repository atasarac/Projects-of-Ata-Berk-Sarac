Hi 👋 I'm Ata, a student majoring in mathematics at Istanbul Bilgi University, currently in my third year. I've created this repository to create a dynamic and useful CV. 

Traditional CVs are designed to mention what one has done without delving into the specifics; in this repository, I'll try to share the projects I've completed.

I didn't do much except academic work but I don't want this work to go unrecognized entirely, so I've shared some (complete and uncomplete) tex files I've written over these years just to show that I am, at least, familiar with the topics included.
