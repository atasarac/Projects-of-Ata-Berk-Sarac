# A Taste of History
To appreciate a field thoroughly, one needs to be familiar with how its professional minds built it throughout its history. Mathematics is no exception. That's why I'll use several resources to introduce these people (or groups of people), their minds, notation available to them, and their purpose in doing mathematics. To be clear, this folder corresponds to the arXiv top-level category _History and Overview_.
