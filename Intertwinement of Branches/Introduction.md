# Intertwinement of Branches
I believe that one understands what this branch includes but I will try to introduce it so that there is little confusion.

Using the arXiv top-level categorization, this branch includes:
- Algebraic Geometry
- Algebraic Topology
- K-Theory and Homology
- General Mathematics
- Information Theory
- Optimization and Control
- Probability
- Statistics Theory

I won't be writing about most of the above because I simply don't know enough about them, but if I do write about them, then they are supposed to be in this folder.
