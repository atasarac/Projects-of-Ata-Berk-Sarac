# Intertwinement of Branches
The examples below are controversial and I am open to edit this if necessary, I don't what a majority of the fields below study exactly, I simply added them here because of what I've seen online, but I believe that they belong here. 

Fields inherently bridging discrete and continuous branches or requiring both perspectives. To better understand what is meant, here are some categories in and out of arXiv that I'd consider in this branch:

- Algebraic Geometry
- Algebraic Topology
- Category Theory
- Dynamical Systems
- Lie Theory
- Mathematical Physics
- Number Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization and Control
- Probability
- Statistics
- Quantum Algebra
- Representation Theory
- K-Theory and Homology

The above categories are given as an example. I'll be writing stuff on one or two (if I'm lucky) of them in this repository.
