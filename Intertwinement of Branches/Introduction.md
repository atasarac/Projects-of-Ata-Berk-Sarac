# Intertwinement of Branches
Fields inherently bridging discrete/continuous or requiring both perspectives.

- Algebraic Geometry
- Algebraic Topology
- Category Theory
- Dynamical Systems
- Lie Theory (Lie Groups, Lie Algebras – smooth groups with discrete symmetry)
- Mathematical Physics (Quantum Field Theory, Lattice Models)
- Number Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization and Control
- Probability
- Statistics
- Quantum Algebra (e.g., quantum groups – algebraic structures with analytic duality)
- Representation Theory
- K-Theory and Homology

I don't know each field equally and so I will not write about most of them, but if I investigate a paper on one of the above, it will belong to this branch.
