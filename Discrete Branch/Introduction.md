# Discrete Branch
I believe that one understands what this branch includes intuitively, but I will try to introduce it so that there is little confusion.

Using the arXiv top-level categorization, this branch includes:
- Combinatorics
- Commutative Algebra
- Logic
- Quantum Algebra
- Rings and Algebras

I won't be writing about most of the above because I simply don't know enough about them, but if I do write about them, then they are supposed to be in this folder.
