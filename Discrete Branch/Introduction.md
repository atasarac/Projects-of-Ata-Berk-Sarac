# Discrete Branch
Fields focusing on finite/countable structures, algorithms, and algebraic/combinatorial methods.

- Combinatorics (encompassing Graph Theory, Enumerative Combinatorics)
- Discrete Algebra (Finite Group Theory, Lattice Theory, Commutative Algebra)
- Discrete Geometry (Polyhedral Geometry, Combinatorial Topology)
- Mathematical Cryptography
- Mathematical Logic (Proof Theory, Model Theory, Computability)
- Order Theory (Posets, Lattices)
- Quantum Computing
- Theoretical Computer Science (Complexity Theory, Formal Languages)

I don't know each field equally and so I will not write about most of them, but if I investigate a paper on one of the above, it will belong to this branch.
