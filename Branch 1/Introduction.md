# Branch 1
Rooted in smooth structures, limits, infinite-dimensional spaces, and analytical methods.

- Analysis of PDEs
- Classical Analysis and ODEs
- Complex Variables
- Differential Geometry
- Functional Analysis (includes Operator Algebras, e.g., C*-algebras)
- General (Point-Set) Topology
- Geometric Analysis (merges aspects of Spectral Theory and Symplectic Geometry)
- Measure Theory (foundation for Probability and Integration)
- Metric Geometry
- Smooth Dynamical Systems (continuous flows, ODEs)
