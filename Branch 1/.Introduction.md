# Branch 1
Fields that are rooted in smooth structures, limits, infinite-dimensional spaces, and analytical methods.

- Analysis of PDEs
- Classical Analysis and ODEs
- Complex Variables
- Differential Geometry
- Functional Analysis (includes Operator Algebras, e.g., C*-algebras)
- General (Point-Set) Topology
- Geometric Analysis
- Measure Theory
- Metric Geometry
- Smooth Dynamical Systems

I don't know each field equally and so I will not write about most of them, but if I investigate a paper on one of the above, it will belong to this branch.
