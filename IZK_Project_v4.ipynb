    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "We consider two public graphs, $G_1 = (V, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V, E_2)$, where the vertex set is defined as $V=\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Prover** claims to know a specific permutation $\\phi: V \\to V$ (an isomorphism) such that:\n",
    "$$G_2 = \\phi(G_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Verifier** does not know $\\phi$. The goal is for the Prover to convince the Verifier that such a $\\phi$ exists without revealing any information about $\\phi$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic Protocol\n",
    "We utilize a standard interactive Zero-Knowledge protocol for Graph Isomorphism. The steps for a single round are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Commitment:** The Prover chooses a random permutation $\\sigma: V \\to V$ and computes a commitment graph $H = \\sigma(G_1)$. The Prover sends $H$ to the Verifier.\n",
    "2. **Challenge:** The Verifier picks a random bit $c \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and sends it to the Prover.\n",
    "3. **Response:**\n",
    "   - If $c=0$, the Prover reveals $\\sigma$.\n",
    "   - If $c=1$, the Prover reveals $\\rho = \\sigma \\circ \\phi^{-1}$.\n",
    "4. **Verification:**\n",
    "   - If $c=0$, the Verifier checks if $H = \\sigma(G_1)$.\n",
    "   - If $c=1$, the Verifier checks if $H = \\rho(G_2)$.\n",

    "### Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)\n",
    "A **Zero-Knowledge Proof** is a cryptographic method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n",

    "An **Interactive Proof System** models computation as an exchange of messages between two parties to determine the validity of a statement.\n",

    "* **The Verifier:** Possesses bounded computational power (usually polynomial time) and is assumed to be honest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction continues until the Verifier is convinced. All interactive proof systems must satisfy two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Completeness:** If the statement is true, an honest prover following the protocol will always convince the honest verifier.\n",
    "* **Soundness:** If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with a negligibly small probability."
