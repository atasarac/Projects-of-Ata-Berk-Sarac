# Continuous Branch
Fields that are rooted in smooth structures, limits, infinite-dimensional spaces, and analytical methods. To better understand what is meant, here are categories in and out of arXiv that I'd consider in this branch:

- Analysis of PDEs
- Classical Analysis and ODEs
- Complex Variables
- Differential Geometry
- Functional Analysis (includes Operator Algebras, e.g., C*-algebras)
- General (Point-Set) Topology
- Geometric Analysis
- Measure Theory
- Metric Geometry
- Smooth Dynamical Systems
