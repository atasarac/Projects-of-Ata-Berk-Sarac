# Continuous Branch
I believe that one understands what this branch includes but I will try to introduce it so that there is little confusion.

Using the arXiv top-level categorization, this branch includes:
- Analysis of PDEs
- Classical Analysis and ODEs
- Complex Variables
- Differential Geometry
- Dynamical Systems
- Functional Analysis
- General Topology
- Geometric Topology
- Mathematical Physics
- Metric Geometry
- Numerical Analysis
- Spectral Theory
- Symplectic Geometry

I won't be writing about most of the above because I simply don't know enough about them, but if I do write about them, then they are supposed to be in this folder.
